Sept 2022
A new version of the PCB (Ver 010B) is shipping. I has all the non-critical components converted to SMD
and factory installed. VERY SIMPLE of the remaining components!
Please refer to the Instructions Ver 010B

OTA Software Updates is now included in the manual. Due to complications with the path to the 
files, OTA updating is NOT recommended unless necessary.
